### JavaFX framework

There was the initial intent to use the the direct JavaFX API, but also searched for the available frameworks.
And found TornadoFX, I liked the approach there how you describe the UI (in the code, and not in FXML), also wanted to 
study Kotlin, which was the perfect match.

### Lang

Kotlin was more like a by product of choosing the TornadoFX, but the desirable one.

### Build Tool

Gradle was chosen like the natural choice for the kotlin projects, and using the Kotlin scripting version of the Gradle.
